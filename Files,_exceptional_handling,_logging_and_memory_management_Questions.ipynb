        "1. What is the difference between interpreted and compiled languages ?\n",
        "  -  In compiled languages, the source code is translated into machine code (binary) by a compiler before it is run.\n",
        "  - In interpreted languages, the source code is not pre-compiled. Instead, an interpreter reads and executes the code line by line at runtime.\n",
        "2. What is exception handling in Python ?\n",
        " - Exception handling in Python is a way to manage errors that occur during the execution of a program. Instead of stopping the program when an error occurs, Python lets you \"catch\" and \"handle\" those errors gracefully.\n",
        "3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling ?\n",
        " - The finally block in Python is used to define code that must be executed, no matter what — whether an exception occurred or not.\n",
        "4. What is logging in Python ?\n",
        " - Logging in Python is the process of recording events, errors, warnings, or information that happens while a program runs. It helps debug, monitor, and track the behavior of an application.\n",
        "5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python ?\n",
        " - The __del__ method in Python is a special (magic) method called a destructor. It is automatically called when an object is about to be destroyed (i.e., when it is garbage collected).\n",
        "6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python ?\n",
        " - Both are used to include external modules in your Python program, but they work a bit differently.\n",
        "7.  How can you handle multiple exceptions in Python ?\n",
        " - Python allows you to handle multiple exceptions in a clean and organized way using multiple except blocks or a single block with multiple exceptions.\n",
        "8. What is the purpose of the with statement when handling files in Python ?\n",
        "  - The with statement in Python is used to simplify file handling by automatically managing resources like file streams.\n",
        "9. What is the difference between multithreading and multiprocessing ?\n",
        " - Both multithreading and multiprocessing are used to perform concurrent (parallel) tasks, but they differ in how they do it and what problems they are best suited for.\n",
        "10. What are the advantages of using logging in a program ?\n",
        "  - Using logging instead of print() statements provides several important benefits, especially in large or production-level applications.\n",
        "11. What is memory management in Python ?\n",
        "  - Memory management in Python refers to the process of allocating, using, and releasing memory efficiently during program execution. It ensures that your program doesn't waste memory or crash due to memory issues.\n",
        "12. What are the basic steps involved in exception handling in Python ?\n",
        "  - Exception handling in Python is the process of managing errors gracefully during program execution. It prevents programs from crashing unexpectedly and allows developers to define how to respond to runtime errors.\n",
        "13. Why is memory management important in Python ?\n",
        " - Memory management is crucial in Python because it directly affects a program’s performance, stability, and scalability.\n",
        "14. What is the role of try and except in exception handling ?\n",
        "  - In Python, try and except blocks are used to catch and handle exceptions (errors) that may occur during program execution. They form the core structure of exception handling.\n",
        "15. How does Python's garbage collection system work ?\n",
        " - Python's garbage collection (GC) system is responsible for automatically reclaiming memory used by objects that are no longer needed. This prevents memory leaks and keeps programs efficient.\n",
        " 16. What is the purpose of the else block in exception handling ?\n",
        "   - The else block in Python exception handling is used to define code that should run only if no exception was raised in the try block.\n",
        "17. What are the common logging levels in Python ?\n",
        "  - Python provides a built-in logging module that helps you track events that happen during program execution. Logging levels define the severity or importance of the events.\n",
        "18. What is the difference between os.fork() and multiprocessing in Python ?\n",
        "  - Both os.fork() and the multiprocessing module are used to create new processes, but they differ in how they work, platform support, and ease of use.\n",
        "19. What is the importance of closing a file in Python ?\n",
        " - Closing a file in Python is very important for maintaining data integrity, managing system resources, and ensuring proper program behavior.\n",
        "20. What is the difference between file.read() and file.readline() in Python ?\n",
        "  - Both file.read() and file.readline() are used to read data from a file, but they behave differently in terms of how much data they read.\n",
        "21. What is the logging module in Python used for ?\n",
        " - The logging module in Python is used to track events that happen during the execution of a program. It provides a flexible framework for emitting log messages from Python programs.\n",
        "22. What is the os module in Python used for in file handling ?\n",
        "  - The os module in Python provides functions to interact with the operating system, especially for file and directory handling.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. What are the challenges associated with memory management in Python ?\n",
        " - While Python provides automatic memory management through its garbage collector, there are still several challenges developers may encounter:\n",
        "     - Memory Leaks\n",
        "     - Circular References\n",
        "     - Garbage Collection Overhead\n",
        "     - Fragmentation\n",
        "     - High Memory Usage with Large Data\n",
        "     - Lack of Explicit Control\n",
        "24. How do you raise an exception manually in Python ?\n",
        "  - In Python, you can raise an exception manually using the raise statement. This is useful when you want to trigger an error intentionally based on certain conditions in your program.\n",
        "25. Why is it important to use multithreading in certain applications ?\n",
        "  - Multithreading allows a program to execute multiple threads (smaller units of a process) concurrently. This is important in applications where responsiveness, efficiency, and parallel task execution are required.\n",
